    "#Project Report on Coursera's Applied Data Science Capstone for Car Accidents Severity\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "A Road Traffic Accident according to Garber (2010) is a random event involving a road user that results into property damage, death or injury. Road Traffic Accidents(RTA) have become not just a National but a Global issue. It is on records that Road traffic accidents cause an estimated 13 million deaths and 20-50 million disabilities worldwide annually with 85% of injury related deaths occurring in developing countries. According to WHO (2007), RTA injuries accounted for 23% of all injury deaths worldwide. This project discusses the severity of car accidents citing City of Seattle.\n",

    "Importance of the Project\n",
    "Determining the causes of Road Traffic accidents\n",
    "Prediction of Road Traffic accidents\n",
    "Determining the effects and severity of Road Traffic Accidents\n",
    "This project is useful to the Road Safety Corporation and stakeholders interested in the welfare and safety of road users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data\n",
    "The chosen dataset comes directly from the Seattle Data on Transportation. It contains data from car crashes from 2004 till date. The dataset comes with a pdf file containing a clear definition for each of the available features. The data for this project is secondarily sourced from https://data.seattle.gov/browse?q=vehicle+accidents , https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/GIS/Collisions_OD.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology\n",
    "Most of the features in the dataset of this project are categorical. In this project Machine Learning Algorithm is used in car collissions and severity recognition. "
